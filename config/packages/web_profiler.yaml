# Web profiler configuration was environment specific and has been moved to
# config/packages/dev/web_profiler.yaml and config/packages/test/web_profiler.yaml
# to avoid loading the web_profiler config in production where the bundle is not enabled.

# This file intentionally left minimal to avoid loading web_profiler in prod.
